## Research Objectives:

Build a predictive model that can forecast 7- day longshore sediment transport to highlight regions and magnitudes of accretion and erosional ‘hotspots’ around Tweed Heads and Collaroy, NSW.



## Scientific Questions/Hypothesis

1. Can we use predictive forecast models for longshore sediment transport to identify the locations and magnitudes of erosional ‘hotspots’ along the NSW Coast?
2. Can a predictive model be used to forecast 7- day longshore sediment transport for two highly urbanised regions on the NSW coastline. 
3. What are the magnitudes of LSD from a 7 day forecast? And what impact does this have on the human environment?

## Summary of Analysis
This project is designed so that the final model and code will be customizable and we hope to consider it a blueprint model that can be applied to any region around the world with nearshore wave data. 
Wave forecast data (including wave height, direction and period) will be imported to a Jupyter notebook as net CDF files. 
The bathymetric data (Source shown in Figure 1) will be used to extract a contour line at 10m depth as a shapefile and converted to points using a spline funtcion.
The angle of incidence is computed between the contour line and the wave direction, using cKD Tree function to create a search mask and average the data points out for a more representative value. 
Using Airy's linear wave theory calculation, the long shore drift and the divergence of drag are calculated along the contour to identify the regions in accretion and the regions in erosion. 
Finally, these sediment distributions will be represented visually in scatter plots.

# Project Guidelines
You must have your dataset(s) and general scope for your project approved by the instructor. The approval process works like this:

Create a new public github repo for your project (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo (Links to an external site.))
Add a README.md file which contains the scientific question / hypothesis you plan to investigate, links to the relevant datasets, and a three sentence summary of the analysis you plan to do.
Add a link to your project repo in your Report as supplementary information.
Don’t forget to make your project repo public; otherwise we won’t be able to see it.
