Research Objectives:

Build a predictive model that can forecast 7- day longshore sediment transport to highlight regions and magnitudes of accretion and erosional ‘hotspots’ around Tweed Heads and Collaroy, NSW.

Scientific Question/Hypothesis

Research Questions: 

1. Can we use predictive forecast models for longshore sediment transport to identify the locations and magnitudes of erosional ‘hotspots’ along the NSW Coast?
2. Can a predictive model be used to forecast 7- day longshore sediment transport for two highly urbanised regions on the NSW coastline. 
3. What are the magnitudes of LSD from a 7 day forecast? And what impact does this have on the human environment?

Summary of Analysis






# Project Guidelines
You must have your dataset(s) and general scope for your project approved by the instructor. The approval process works like this:

Create a new public github repo for your project (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo (Links to an external site.))
Add a README.md file which contains the scientific question / hypothesis you plan to investigate, links to the relevant datasets, and a three sentence summary of the analysis you plan to do.
Add a link to your project repo in your Report as supplementary information.
Don’t forget to make your project repo public; otherwise we won’t be able to see it.
